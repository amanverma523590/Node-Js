# Node.js Practice Folder

I created this folder to **properly learn Node.js from scratch**.  
This is not a project repo — this is my **daily practice + notes folder**.

I will write code, break things, fix them, and understand how backend actually works.

---

## Why I am learning Node.js
- To become strong in backend
- To understand how APIs work
- To clear interviews (fresher level)
- To complete my MERN stack properly

---

## How I will use this folder
- One topic at a time
- Small examples
- No skipping basics
- Notes inside code when needed

---

## What I’ll learn here
- How Node runs JavaScript
- Core modules (fs, path, http, etc.)
- Creating servers
- Using npm packages
- Express basics
- Connecting backend with frontend
- Simple real-life logic

---

## Status
Started learning Node.js 🚀  
Progress will be slow but solid.
